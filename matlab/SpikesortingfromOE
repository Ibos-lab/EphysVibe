HOW TO PRE-PROCESS DATA WITH KILOSORT AND PHY:

I've installed kilosort3 in home/spikesorting/Documents/MATLAB/Kilosort_main.
I've installed npy matlab in home/spikesorting/Documents/MATLAB/npy-matlab-master.

If you install some other matlab codes, make sure to install them in a dedicated directory (don't mess with KS or the rest  please).

This computer is not on INT's network and don't have a direct access to Niolon. In order to download a directory from Niolon, do it in ssh. In a terminal:
scp -r YOUR.ID@niolon.int.univ-amu.fr:/envau/work/PATHTOYOURDATA /YOUR-directory-ON-THIS-COMPUTER

WARNING: This is not a computer dedicated to storing data. Out of respect to Lionel Velly, let us not store data on it. Once You are done sorting and preprocessing your data, please remove them!



1. copy data in a folder with fast ssd access. Mine are in home/spikesorting/Documents/data/IBOS
2. USE KILOSORT TO SORT DATA:
	2.1. Create a spatial model of your electrodes with createChannelMapFile.m.Place it in a dedicated directory
	2.2. Copy main_kilosort3.m and StandardConfing_MOVEME.m in a dedicated directory (can be the one of the channelap). 
	2.3. In main_kilosort3 you need to point to the path (i) rootZ: the data (binary data file)), (ii) rootH: for a temporary file which will be used by kilosort (make sure it is a fast SSD) (iii) pathToYourConfigFile (the copied filed mentionned in 2.1) (iv) the name of the channel map.

	2.4. Adjust the different variables as desired, e.g.:
		2.4.1. ops.fshigh for changing your high pass filter
		2.4.2. ops.Th changes the threshold of deticting spikes. 1st value for  preprocessing, second value for later sorting. e.g. [15 5]
	2.5. Do the same thing in StandardConfig_MOVEME.m
		2.5.1. ops.chanMap path to your channelmap
		2.5.2. ops.fs your sampling rate (OE 30 kHz)
		2.5.3. ...

	2.6. run main_kilosort3.m (it will create a kilosort3 directory in the specified location, Make sure the output directory does not exist yet. adjust)
	

3. USE PHY to manually curate data. https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy I've installed Phy on a conda environment called Phy_env. Please don't change this environment. If you want to install some other programs like spikeinterface,create a different conda environment.
	3.1. Open a terminal
	3.2. conda activate Phy_env
	3.3. cd to the path of the kilosort data : hoem/spikesorting/.../kilosort3/
	3.4. phy extract-waveforms params.py (will extract waveforms and allow you to see PCs in Phy)
	3.5. open your data in Phy: phy template-gui params.py
	3.6 do your thing
	3.7 save and quit

4. Prepocess data to extract/align spikes, LFPs and task events. I've created a routine to preprocess open ephys data in matlab. Feel free to do one in Python if you want. For Open Ephys data visit:  https://github.com/open-ephys/analysis-tools; https://github.com/open-ephys/open-ephys-matlab-tools; 
	4.1 It load continuous data, fitler them to remove spikes, downsample them to 1kHz
	4.2 Gets spike timestamps, ids, and depth
	4.3 Gets Monkeylogic behavior files
	4.4 Recombine all that in a single cell structure
	4.5 save it in a dedicated directory

5. Transfer back your data to Niolon:
	5.1  kilosort data: scp -r /path/to/data/folder INT.identifier@niolon.int.univ-amu.fr:/envau/work/Path/to/data
	5.2 the created cell structure: scp /path/to/saved/cell/structure INT.identifier@niolon.int.univ-amu.fr:/envau/work/Path/to/cell/struct/data

6. Remove data from this computer. Start over with new data.
